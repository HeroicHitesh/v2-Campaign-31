```solidity
bytes4 private constant SELECTOR = bytes4(keccak256(bytes('transfer(address,uint256)')));

function _safeTransfer(address token, address to, uint value) private {
    (bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(SELECTOR, to, value));
    require(success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))), 'UniswapV2: TRANSFER_FAILED');
}
```

- Used Encoding/Decoding or Call Method: `abi.encodeWithSelector`, `abi.decode`, `call` is used.

## Explanation

- Purpose: ERC20 tokens can be securely transferred from the UniswapV2Pair contract to a designated address using the `_safeTransfer` function. This function ensures tokens be transferred reliably during swaps or liquidity provision operations, making it a crucial utility function of the contract.
- Detailed Usage:
    - Encoding: The call data for the `transfer` function of an ERC20 token is encoded by the function using `abi.encodeWithSelector`. This generates the proper function signature that the `call` method requires, using the supplied parameters (`to` and `value`).
    - Calling: Calling: To deliver the encoded data to the ERC20 contract, a low-level call is made using the `call` function. By avoiding Solidity's function call limitations, this approach offers greater control and flexibility, but it must be used carefully to guarantee safety.
    - Decoding: To determine whether the operation was successful, the call's result is decoded using `abi.decode`. This is done to make sure that data returned, if any, corresponds to the expected boolean output of the `transfer` function.
- Impact: The `_safeTransfer` function significantly enhances the security and reliability of token transfers within the Uniswap V2 protocol. By using low-level calls and explicit success checks, it mitigates risks associated with token transfer failures, such as reversion and incomplete operations. This function ensures the integrity of liquidity operations and swap transactions, maintaining the protocol's robustness and user trust.
